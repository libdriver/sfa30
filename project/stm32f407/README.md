MDK is the Keil ARM project and your Keil version must be 5 or higher.Keil ARM project needs STMicroelectronics STM32F4 Series Device Family Pack and you can download from https://www.keil.com/dd2/stmicroelectronics/stm32f407zgtx.

EW is the IAR ARM project and your IAR version must be 9 or higher.

#### 2.2 Serial Port Parameter

Baud Rate: 115200.

Data Bits : 8.

Stop Bits: 1.

Parity: None.

Flow Control: None.

#### 2.3 Serial Port Assistant

We use '\n' to wrap lines.If your serial port assistant displays exceptions (e.g. the displayed content does not divide lines), please modify the configuration of your serial port assistant or replace one that supports '\n' parsing.
